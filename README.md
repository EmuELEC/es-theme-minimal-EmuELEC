# MINIMAL THEME

​	This theme is an attempt at making EmulationStation look more like a game system.



Modern Game Systems (PS4, Xbox One, Switch, etc.) deliver a very specific experience compared to a computer. You turn it on, see a simple boot screen, and are in the menu in seconds. You know what you are getting in to. It's made abundantly clear that this is a video game machine. The games are front and center, and everything is wrapped up in a clean, *minimal*, interface...

That is what I believe sets a game system apart from the Raspberry Pi. Sure, the interface is fast, and somewhat nice looking. But it doesn't feel like a video game system. This is where the Minimal theme steps in.

​	The theme is meant to look as clean as possible. I recommend using this theme on the newest version of EmulationStation since the theme uses new features like Z-Index and Variables.

The background is also customizable, info on changing that (and other things) will be in the guide.txt.
